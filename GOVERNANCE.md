# Governance


- **Maintainers**: responsible for technical direction and releases.
- **Committers**: regular contributors with merge rights after maintainer vote.
- **Review process**: at least 2 approvals for non-trivial changes, 1 for docs/tests.
- **Releases**: time-based for minors, as-needed for patches; semantic versioning.
